*  Description: <BR>
*    This node is a server for the user interface, it receives what the user
* 	 writes and it acts depending on it. If the client ask for the random 
* 	 position behaviour it calls the server /random_position and it waits 
*  	 for it to be finished, it also checks if the client requests the behaviour
* 	 to stop and in that case it cancels the previous goal and waits for the
* 	 next command. In the mean time it also sends information to the user_interface
* 	 node, it publishes a topic when a goal has been reached (True) or cancelled
* 	 (False) so that the user_interface can keep track of the reached and cancelled
* 	 goals. Also whenevera goal is reached it publishes on the topic /time the
* 	 time in seconds between the request of the goal and the completion of it.

 * is true it is also checked if the robot is already moving towards a goal 
 * with the global variable notgoing. If the robot is not already moving
 * a new goal is set, if on the other hand the robot was already going it 
 * is checked if the goal is reached, in this case information are published
 * on the topics /time and /reach. If the global variable start is false 
 * I check if the robot is already moving, if that is the case I cancel 
 * the goal and publish information on the /reach topic. If the robot is 
 * still and the start variable is false the program does nothing.
